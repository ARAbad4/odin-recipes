        <h2> Description</h2>
            <p> This recipe is my mom's version of chicken adobo. When my mom made chicken adobo I never saw her use a recipe. It was all made based on her "feel". After numerous calls with her, I have documented her recipe so I can make it for my family and possibly my kids make it for their families.</p>   <p> Please note serving size feeds four and is typically served over white rice and a green vegetable, i.e., bokchoy, broccoli, etc..</p>
